# Shakespeare-Scrape
Screen scraper for extracting text from Romeo and Juliet.

Fires an HTTP request, retrieves the page's .htm file, then parses that to a human readable script file with associated types that can be imported into MacOutreach's GraphicSVG comics.

This project was made available for McMaster Outreach's summer 2020 Dynamic Comics camps.
